# Run Shortcut

Run Shortcut lets you access all of your shortcuts from the Notification Center Shortcuts widget. Use your voice to run and edit shortcuts on your device, or trigger shortcuts to run on remote iOS devices using NoteCuts.

When running for the first time, you’ll configure the following options:

- Shortcuts Cache: Makes accessing all of your shortcuts from notification center fast.
- Run Mode: Choose between running the shortcut, editing it, adding it to a NoteCut, or displaying a dialog with all three choices.
- Launch Action: When launching Run Shortcut, you can dictate the shortcut you want to run immediately, enter it via text, or view all installed shortcuts.
- Dictation Language: Got a shortcut whose name is in a different language? Switch between dictation languages so you can always find your shortcuts with your voice.

## NoteCuts Integration

Run Shortcut can run shortcuts on your iOS device even when NoteCuts is running in the background, monitoring for triggering events to run shortcuts automatically. Simply use the **Run with NoteCuts** run mode after selecting a shortcut to run. It will be added to either a local or remote NoteCut for execution at the next NoteCut evaluation period.

## Localization
Run Shortcut is available in English, but the application is also supplied with auto-translated localized files for the supported dictation languages on iOS.

Since machine translation is never perfect, your help would come greatly in handy. If you are a native speaker of one of these languages, consider contributing to improving Run Shortcut's localization files.

You can use the Localization Helper shortcut to assist with localizing Run Shortcut into your language.

- When the localization file is complete, submit a pull request on [the Run Shortcut GitHub page](https://github.com/adamtow/promptkit/tree/master/localization/).

You can also inspect the files for each supported language's language dictionary in the `localization/application`  and `localization/widget` directories. Help make Run Shortcut more accurate and more universal for all iOS users!
